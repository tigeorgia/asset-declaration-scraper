<!-- This file contains the strings on which the text-extractor is based.
	The file is divided into q-elements, one for each question in the Asset Declaration PDF's (and question 0 for the information of the person who filed the AD
	
	Explanation:
	n-attribute: unique ID of the question
	t-attribute: name of the table belonging to this question
	a-attribute: arity of the relation without the last ID column. (thus true arity is plus 1)
	w-element: contains the complete text of the question.
	h-elements: contain the complete text of the headers of the table, numbered, ordered in reading order (from left to right)

	s-element:  part contains a  substring of the w or h text that is both
		* long enough to provide a unique match
		* short enough to fit in one text element.
		Example: <h n='3'><s>Location of the property, total</s> area</h>
		
			because in the XML we have 
			
			<text top="107" left="644" width="257" height="17" font="5">
			<b>Location of the property, total</b>
			</text>
	outcome-element: specifies the output schema (that is, the names of the columns from left to right)
	
	We have exactly the same information for the Georgiam PDF;s, but now we use wg and hg elements to store the Georgian information.
	Also in the Georgian elements we use the s-element to indicate the relevant substring for matching a text element.
	
	We can add the Georgian information after the <outschema> element, in the same order as for English. Thus 
	<wg><s>XXXXXXXXXXXXX</s>XXXXXXXXXXX</wg>
        <hg n='1'><s>XXXXXXXX</s></hg>
        <hg n='2'><s>XXXXXXX</s>XXXXXXX</hg>
